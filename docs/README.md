# Yeoman Gulp-Angular Generator documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the generator. The goal of the generator is to bringing to you a cutting edge project with all technologies and optimization you could want or even you don't know yet that you want!

But it can't and shouldn't match the requirements of all projects. It's why it generates a code that you have to make it yours and adapt it to your project.

* [Usage](usage.md) - Installation, main gulp commands, options, parameters...
* [User Guide](user-guide.md) - How to use your new project and beneficiate from all tools featured
* [How it Works](how-it-works.md) - Description of all mechanisms in the build process.
