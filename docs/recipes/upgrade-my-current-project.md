# How shall I properly upgrade my current project with the last version of the generator?

## [#547](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular/issues/547)

there is no upgrade provide by yeoman.
You should update the generator by `npm -g install generator-gulp-angular` and rerun `yo gulp-angular` in your current project.

But be careful. Before upgrade I suggest you to create a branch in your project.
